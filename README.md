# Naive Genetic Neural Network
A very simple and somewhat fast c# .NET genetic neural network

Inputs: A set of training data in my case I was training it with english words
Outputs: Whether an input is similar to the training set (positive number), or close to random nonsense (negative number); The weights of the network.

There are still many things to do such as loading settings file because right now they are bakd into the code as constants.

Enjoy,
